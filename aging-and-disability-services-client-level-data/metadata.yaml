  Aging And Disability Services Client Level Data
description: |
  The Cityâ€™s Aging and Disability Services (ADS) addresses the environmental, economic, and social factors that influence the health and well-being of older adults. In an effort to ensure all older adults experience stable health and can age in place, the Human Services Department invests in a combination of direct services and in funding agencies that serve our older adults. ADS supports older individuals, those living with a disability, and their families.
