    description: 
      The COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CV19 Index) is a predictive model 
      that identifies people who are likely to have a heightened vulnerability 
      to severe complications from COVID-19 (commonly referred to as “The Coronavirus”). 
      The CV19 Index is intended to help hospitals, federal / state / local public 
      health agencies and other healthcare organizations in their work to identify, 
      plan for, respond to, and reduce the impact of COVID-19 in their communities.
