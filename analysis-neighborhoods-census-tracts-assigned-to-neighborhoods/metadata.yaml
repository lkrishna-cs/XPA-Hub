  Analysis Neighborhoods Census Tracts Assigned To Neighborhoods
description: |
  The Department of Public Health and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, with support from the Planning Department, created 41 neighborhoods by grouping 2010 Census tracts, using common real estate and residents’ definitions for the purpose of providing consistency in the analysis and reporting of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and data on City-funded programs and services. They are not codified in Planning Code nor Administrative Code.
